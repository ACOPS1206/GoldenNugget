"""Pull the device's StatusBarOverrides.archive and print its schema.

Research tool for the iOS 27 status bar work -- it is NOT part of the apply
flow and nothing in the app calls it.

Why: `src/tweaks/status_bar/statusbar_archive.py` can only write the two
carrier-name entries, because the rest of the record's key names are not
knowable from source. SpringBoard rewrites that archive in its own canonical
form whenever it applies an override, so a dump taken after one apply/reboot
contains the real class names and keys -- which is exactly what the writer
needs to stop guessing.

    # 1. apply the carrier-name tweak in the app, let it reboot
    # 2. then run this
    python3 tools/fetch_statusbar_archive.py

If the device has never had an override applied there is no archive to read
and this says so -- that is a normal answer, not a failure. SpringBoard
unlinks a record that carries no overrides.
