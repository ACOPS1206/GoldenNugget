"""
AFC-backed parallel media backup/restore channel.

On iOS 27 the three-phase restore wipes the device (security recovery), so
photos/videos must survive on this computer between Phase 2 and Phase 3. They
are normally carried inside the protective mobilebackup2 backup, which is
slow (the whole Media tree uploads through DeviceLink). When
``use_afc_media`` is on, the *bulk* photo trees (``DCIM``,
``PhotoStreamsData`` — the actual photo/video files) are instead pulled over
plain ``com.apple.afc`` in *parallel* with the mobilebackup2 backup of
everything else, and pushed back over the same channel during Phase 5
(after the Phase 4 reboot and reconnect, on the freshly-booted device).

The scope is deliberately narrow: only the top-level Media trees in
``AFC_MEDIA_TREES`` go over AFC. ``PhotoData`` — the photo library database
(CPLAssets) plus its protected metadata (``PhotoData/UBF`` is NOT listable
over the media AFC service; it fails with AFC error 10 / PERM_DENIED on
iOS 27) — stays inside the mobilebackup2 backup, which reads it natively.
The mobilebackup2 upload filter and the manifest prune both exclude the same
``AFC_MEDIA_TREES`` so the split stays coherent end-to-end (no wasted
uploads, no manifest rows pointing at payloads that were never written).

Design rules:
- Progress is reported as strings only (never numbers): the mobilebackup2
  numbers drive the progress bar, and a concurrent numeric feed would corrupt
  it.
- Pull-side failures are fatal by default: the media dir is the ONLY copy of
  the user's photos after Phase 2 wipes the device, so a silent drop is data
  loss. Callers that need best-effort pass ``on_error="warn"``.
- Symlinks are skipped (never copied as files): following them could escape
  the Media tree and would duplicate content.
