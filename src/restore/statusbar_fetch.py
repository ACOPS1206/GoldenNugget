"""Fetch the on-device ``StatusBarOverrides.archive`` for format research.

Why this exists
---------------
``statusbar_archive.py`` deliberately ships only the two carrier-name entries,
because the rest of the ``_SBSystemStatusStatusBarOverridesArchiveRecord``
schema is not known from source and guessing an ``NSKeyedArchiver`` key ships
a status bar that fails to draw. The missing half of the schema can only come
from a device: SpringBoard *writes* that archive itself whenever it applies an
override, so a carrier-only archive that went through one apply/reboot comes
back rewritten in SpringBoard's own canonical form -- with the real class
names and key names in it.

That round trip is this module's whole job. It is a research/diagnostic
channel, not part of the apply flow: nothing in the app calls it.

The file is read over the same channel the PosterBoard database already uses
-- a targeted ``mobilebackup2`` run whose factory info lists no app containers
and whose mid-stream filter keeps exactly one path. No jailbreak, no Developer
Mode, nothing but a paired device that the user trusts.

Runs against ``Library/SpringBoard/StatusBarOverrides.archive`` in
**HomeDomain**, i.e. the same place ``apply_ios27_tweak`` writes it, so what
comes out is byte-comparable with what we produce.
